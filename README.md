# Steam Achievements Discord Bot

This Discord bot displays unlocked Steam achievements in real-time and offers various features to track your game achievement progress. It uses the Discord and Steam APIs.

## Features

### 1. New Steam Achievement Unlocked Alerts

The bot sends messages (text and image) to a specified channel when a new achievement is detected for one of the registered players. Updates occur every 60 seconds.
This feature can either display achievements only for tracked games (those registered with `/add-game`) or for *all* games, as configured with `/set_new_achievements_display`. 

It also indicates which other players have already unlocked this achievement and the global unlock percentage. The player's current progress for the game is also displayed.

### 2. Achievement Listing Commands

The bot provides several commands to list and compare achievements for specific games. These commands allow you to view achievement progress, identify missing achievements, and compare your progress with your friends!

*   **`/list_locked_achievements`**: For the user executing the command, it lists achievements still locked, their global unlock percentage, and the avatars of other players who have already unlocked each achievement.

*   **`/list_compare_achievements`**: Displays achievements that are locked for the user executing the command AND that are unlocked by at least one other registered player. This helps identify achievements you might want to pursue that others in your group have already achieved.

*   **`/list_all_achievements`**: Displays all achievements for a game, whether unlocked or not. 

*   **`/progress`**: Displays the progress of each player for a given game and their playtime.

### 3. Achievement Unlock History (`/history`)

Displays the history of the number of unlocked achievements for a specified game.

### 4. Achievement Leaderboard (`/leaderboard`)

Displays a leaderboard of players based on the number of games completed. Also displays the total number of achievements unlocked in any games.

### 5. Achievement Report (`/achievement_report` and `/set-achievements-report-schedule`)

*   **`/achievement_report`**: Generates a report of unlocked achievements for a specified period (last 24 hours, last week, last month, or last year).
*   **`/set-achievements-report-schedule`**: Configures an automatic report to be sent periodically (daily, weekly, or monthly) to a designated channel. You can also specify a timestamp for the first report or disable the automatic reports.

### 6. Configuration and Management Commands

*   `/add_player`: Adds a player to track. You need to provide the Steam ID for each player you want to track. For the bot to function correctly, players must set their basic and game details to "Public" on Steam at [https://steamcommunity.com/id/superlambda/edit/settings](https://steamcommunity.com/id/superlambda/edit/settings). Additionally, ensure the "Always keep my total playtime private even if users can see my game details" option is unchecked.
*   `/remove_player`: Removes a tracked player.
*   `/add_game`: Registers a game. Needed to list achievements, display progress, and history of a specific game. 
*   `/remove_game`: Removes a registered game.
*   `/list_players`: Lists all tracked players.
*   `/list_games`: Lists all registered games.
*   `/change_user_color`: Changes the color associated with a user in the history.
*   `/set_new_achievements_display`: Configures the channel where new achievement alerts should be sent, and indicates if all games should be tracked.
*   `/set_achievement_report_schedule`: Configures the frequency and channel for achievement reports.
*   `/ping`: Checks the bot's liveness.
*   `/refresh_owned_games`: Updates the list of games owned by players. Use this when owned games of a specific player were not fetched correctly (e.g., total playtime is missing or games are missing in the leaderboard).

## Required Configuration

To use this bot, you will need the following:

*   **Steam Web API Key**: Obtain it from [https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).
*   **Discord Bot Token & Client ID**: Create a bot application on the Discord developer portal: [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

## Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Lambda-fr/Steam-achievements-alert-discord-bot.git
    cd Steam-achievements-alert-discord-bot
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Prepare your `.env` file:**
    Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the following variables:
    ```env
    STEAM_API_KEY=YOUR_STEAM_API_KEY
    DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID
    DISCORD_GUILD_IDS=YOUR_DISCORD_SERVER_ID_1,YOUR_DISCORD_SERVER_ID_2
    DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
    STEAM_LANG=english
    ```
    *   `STEAM_API_KEY`: Your Steam API key.
    *   `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`: Your Discord bot application ID.
    *   `DISCORD_GUILD_IDS`: A comma-separated list of the Discord server IDs where the bot will be used. You can find a server's ID by enabling developer mode in Discord (User Settings > Advanced) then right-clicking on the server.
    *   `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token.
    *   `STEAM_LANG`: The language for Steam information (e.g., "french", "english").

4.  **Create the data file and deploy Slash Commands:**
    The `setup.js` script creates `src/data.json` if it doesn't already exist, and deploys the bot's slash commands to Discord. Make sure `.env` is correctly filled before running this step.
    ```bash
    node setup.js
    ```
    You should see confirmation messages in the console indicating that the commands have been reloaded for your servers.

5.  **Start the bot:**
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
    The bot should now be online on your Discord server.

## Initial Usage

After starting the bot:

1.  **Add players and games:** Use the `/add_player` and `/add_game` commands to start tracking achievements and to use game-specific commands.
2.  **Set notification channel:** Use the `/set_new_achievements_display` command in the channel where you want to receive new achievement alerts.
3. **Set automatic report :** Use the `/set-achievements-report-schedule` command if you want to set periodic report.

## Running with Docker

A prebuilt image is published to GHCR at `ghcr.io/whit3str/steam-achievements-alert-discord-bot` on every push to `main` (tag `latest`) and on version tags (e.g. `v1.2.3`).

1.  **Prepare your `.env` and data files locally** (they are mounted/injected into the container, never baked into the image):
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    mkdir -p data
    echo '{"users":{},"games":{},"guilds":{}}' > data/data.json
    ```
    Fill in `.env` with your real values (see step 3 above).

    > **Important:** `data/data.json` must exist as a **file** before the first `docker compose up`. If the host path doesn't exist yet, Docker creates it as a **directory** when setting up the bind mount, which breaks the bot (`EISDIR` error in the logs). If this happens, remove the wrongly-created directory, recreate `data.json` as an actual file with the command above, then run `docker compose down && docker compose up -d` (a plain restart won't fix it, the mount type is fixed at container creation).

2.  **Deploy the slash commands.** Either set `DEPLOY_COMMANDS=true` in `.env` before starting the bot (it deploys commands then starts the bot automatically, in one `docker compose up`), or deploy them manually once:
    ```bash
    docker compose run --rm bot node setup.js
    ```
    If you use `DEPLOY_COMMANDS=true`, remember to set it back to `false` afterwards to avoid redeploying on every restart (Discord rate-limits this endpoint).

3.  **Start the bot:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

4.  **View logs:**
    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f bot
    ```

By default `docker-compose.yml` pulls the `latest` tag from GHCR. To pin a specific version, set `TAG=v1.2.3` before running compose (e.g. `TAG=v1.2.3 docker compose up -d`). To build the image locally instead of pulling it, run `docker build -t ghcr.io/whit3str/steam-achievements-alert-discord-bot:latest .`.
